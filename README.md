## ✍️ **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Creative Design:** The theme and style came together seamlessly, and the sprites were fun to design.
- **Core Mechanics:** Used some of the bugs in the game and used them as a features. For example, player can jump in the air and should rely on pixel-perfect jumps.

### Challenges:
- **Limited by time :/ :** I haven't implemented all the stuff that I wanted into my game, but considering that this is the first game I ever made alone, I'm happy with the things that I have now!
- **Bug Fixes:** Camera movement was probably the hardest part about this whole project for me.

### Lessons Learned:
- **Ask for help:** I realised that I shouldn't be ashamed when I don't know something, I should ask for help whenever I feel like I need one!
- **Keep it Simple:** Don't overcomlicate things! Finish with basic things that your game has to have so it could be called a game and then focus on adding things that would make game more atractive or interesting.
