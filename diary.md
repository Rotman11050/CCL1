    Implemented gravity and presented my idea to the tuttor. Had a problem with implementing the movement of the player. 
    Reconsiderd if the platformer project was a mistake but thed remeberd, courage is a matter of style in the thoughest times.

    To do:
    -Make dynamic boundaries for the image on Canvas (Depending on dimensions of it, use it to determin playable area)
    -Adding the collectables
    19;24
    Today I had changed gravity function so my character doesn't fall of the map when he jumps twice in the same place or under the block.
    After that I had added enemies, although they still don't do anything, added collectables.
